# Photo Rewind

I wanted to create a small page that allows you to upload your small video and rewind it via mouse move. Turned out video api doesn't allow to do quick rewinds. So I ended up using a burst of photos.

User can upload a burst of photos and rewind them via mouse move (touch).

Why? Not sure yet, it looks fun. My 1 year old daughter loved to play with it :)
